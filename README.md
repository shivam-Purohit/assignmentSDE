## Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

ðŸ§  What is MCP in this Context?
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a structured way to expose your app's models, operations, and logic in a machine-readable format, so AI tools can interact with it seamlessly.

MCP helps an assistant:

- Know what an Itinerary, Day, Activity, or Review means

- Discover available operations: create_itinerary, get_recommendations, add_review, etc.

- Know expected inputs/outputs, types, constraints

- Trigger those operations programmatically via the AP

It will rank based on overall cost and will suggest the cheapest first. We can sort based on ratings, reviews by users and popularity.
